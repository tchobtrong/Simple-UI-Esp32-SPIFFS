# Simple UI Esp32 SPIFFS

Simple-UI-Esp32-SPIFFS is a minimal UI based on python script to run esptool.exe and mkspiffs.exe for uploading an ini file or a selected file into ESP32 platforms.

This program has been successfully test with ESP32-PICO (default partitions).

All credits go to Steve Marple and yurilopes. All I did was adapt the source to work on SPIFFS aiming at providing this feature for ESP8266 and ESP32 platforms
